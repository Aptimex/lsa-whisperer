= Cloud Authentication Package
:toc: macro

The cloud authentication package (AP) supports logons with Azure and Microsoft accounts.
It is also the security support provider (SSP) for OAuth 2.0 authentication with Microsoft's cloud services.

toc::[]

== Key Terms

Some terms appear a lot when analyzing cloudap which are provided here:

* Package: Structure of information about a cloudap plugin, which will be either AzureAD or MicrosoftAccount
* TokenBlob: A PRT, also referred to as a "Cloud TGT"

== Functions

The protocol messages that cloudap or its plugins support are not documented by Microsoft.
Microsoft provides a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/3f562cb9-4456-4de7-9267-c3686bf2a81c[small example of calling one plugin function] with little context. 
The remainder of the available functions and their usage were reverse engineered and documented here.
It is not known on which version of NT these functions were originally introduced or if new functions have been introduced since this writting.

|===

=== ReinitPlugin

Unloads then reloads all cloudap plugins.

=== GetTokenBlob

The `_USER_CACHE_ENTRY` structure has a DPAPI protected entry named TokenBlob, also referred to as the CloudTGT.
This function unprotects and returns the TokenBlob entry.

=== CallPluginGeneric

Call a CloudAP plugin function.
The function id and its arguments are serialized as a single JSON object.

=== ProfileDeleted

Need to finish auditing.

=== GetAuthenticatingProvider

The `_LOGON_SESSION` structure has a GUID entry to identify which cloudap plugin was used (e.g., AzureAD or MicrosoftAccount)
This function returns that GUID entry.

=== RenameAccount

Will update the account name in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM).
Need to finish auditing.

=== RefreshTokenBlob

Refresh a logon session's TokenBlob using the `RefreshToken` cloudap function plugin.

=== GenARSOPwd

Generate a Winlogon Automatic Restart Sign-On (ASRO) password and store it on the file system.

=== SetTestParas

Sets a TestFlags bit.
A ULONG must be provided after the call ID.

|===
| TestFlags | Description
| 1         | Enable the internal `FlushIdentityCache` function
| 2         | Enable the use of the internal `*PreRS2` functions
|===

=== TransferCreds

Transfers creds between two CloudAP logon sessions.
Will generate a new logon session for dst if needed.
Src then dst LUIDs must follow call ID.

=== ProvisionNGCNode

Todo.
Ngc Prime Cached Logon In Lsa.

=== GetPwdExpiryInfo

Returns a FILETIME for the TokenBlob expiry time followed by a unicode string.

=== DisableOptimizedLogon

=== GetUnlockKeyType

Return the UnlockKeyType from the UserCacheEntry which can only be of value `x` for `0 < x < 8`.

=== GetPublicCachedInfo

Retrieve PublicCacheData from disk, deserialize, and return it.
`code + package guid + uint 6 + (uint + uint) + (uint + uint).`

=== GetAccountInfo

Todo.

=== GetDpApiCredKeyDecryptStatus

Return DpApiCredKeyDecryptStatus from user cache entry.

=== IsCloudToOnPremTgtPresentInCache

Todo.

== Plugins

Cloudap currently only supports 2 plugins which facilitate logons to Azure AD (AAD) and a Microsoft Account (MSA).
The internal names and IDs for interacting with the plugins are provided here.

.Plugins
[%header]
|===
| Plugin Name           | GUID                                   | File

| Windows Live ID (MSA) | `D7F9888F-E3FC-49b0-9EA6-A85B5F392A4F` | MicrosoftAccountCloudAP.dll
|===

Cloudap allows each plugin to implement a number of functions for cloudap or other applications to call.
The full list of functions, their call ID, and the plugins that support them are listed here.

== Key Structures

Reverse engineering some structures were key in understanding the internal message protocol functions that cloudap provides.
A description and partial definition for each of these structures is provided here for others to use and research further.
These may not be completely accurate and contributions are appreciated.

=== _LOGON_SESSION

Cloudap maintains a linked list of `_LOGON_SESSION` structures for each cloudap provided user logon session.
New entries have been appended to this structure over time, but the current list of known entries and their offsets are as follows.

._LOGON_SESSION
