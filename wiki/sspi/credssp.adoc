= Credential Delegation Security Package

The credssp package implements a security protocol for delegating (e.g. transmitting) credentials from a client to a server for remote authentication.
The client first establishes a TLS channel with the server.
The client then authenticates with the server using the Simple and Protected Negotiate (SPNEGO) protocol.
The credssp package does not support any authentication package (AP) functions and as such there are no plans to support credssp commands in Lsa Whisperer for directly interacting with it.
