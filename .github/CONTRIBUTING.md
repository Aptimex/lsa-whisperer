## Getting started

The following outlines the majority of contributions that are accepted.
If you do not see a topic for the contribution you would like to make, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/discussions) and we would be happy to talk about including it!

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the the source code or docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we do not assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes

#### Make changes in the wiki

Click the appropriate `.asciidoc` file in the [wiki folder](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/tree/master/wiki) to make changes such as a typos, sentence fixes, and broken links. Click the edit button for the file. This will navigate you through forking the repository to make changes directly on GitHub.

#### Make source code changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Follow the [building guide](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer?tab=readme-ov-file#building) for installing dependencies.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Please use the following checklist when commiting code to speed up the review process.

- If you have updated wiki content, confirm that your changes render as expected on GitHub.
- Check your changes for grammar and spelling issues.
- Review your changes for technical accuracy.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the PR template so that we can review it.
- Do not forget to [link your PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a project maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, by either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, please mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
