= Credential Delegation Security Package

The credssp package implements a security protocol for delegating (e.g. transmitting) credentials from a client to a server for remote authentication.
The client first establishes an TLS channel with the server.
The client then authenticates with the server using the Simple and Protected Negotiate (SPNEGO) protocol which in turn will use either the Kerberos or NTLM protocol.
