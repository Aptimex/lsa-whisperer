NOTE: The internal function will be located in `livessp.dll`.

Oddly, the `TransferCredential` command may also be called by using a message id of `0x402`.
In NT 6.2 `SeTcbPrivilege` was required for all calls.
NT 6.3 removed that requirment for all calls except for `TransferCredential` which still requires `SeTcbPrivilege`.
